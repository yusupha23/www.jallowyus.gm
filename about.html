          A little History
        </h2>
        <p> 
          My name is yusupha jallow, I am a muslim by religion, I am from West Africa in a small country called The Gambia, I live with my parents from childhood to now. I am a commerce student and attended kotu senior secondary school  as my first senior school, but by then I was very stubborn,  I did not either like studying or going to school, and I graduated there at  the year 2018 with a very poor result.

          My parents were very disappointed about my result and that was when my father took me to the village called georgetown to repeat my senior school at Armitage senior secondary school. That was when I realize I had to change cause my dad took me to the village to learn a lesson.
          
          I was in that village without a family or a friend and the weather there was very bad.  I repeated at grade eleven and then started to took my education seriously and I graduated there at the year 2020 with flying colors.
          </p> 

          <h2>
            A Little Context
          </h2>
          <p>
            Currently studying at MDI(Management Development Institute) as a computer science student on my second year second semester,and my focus on this course is  web development, operating system, computer networks and database management combining them into a full career is a weird and ongoing challenge.
                
            My hobbies are playing football, watching movies, having happy times with my family, love going to the beach to enjoy the fresh air, and I really love to be with my mates to enjoy our free times together I also love traveling and hoping one day all my dreams will be achieved. 
            
            I'm not currently available for any contract work, full time roles, or side projects. 
          </p>
          <h2>
            About My Sponsor
          </h2>

          <p>
            I am giving a special thank you to my sponsor, who made a decision to help me achieve all my goals. I am from a poor extended family, my father cannot afford to pay school for all his kids, and he's the only bread winner in my family so things are hard for him though, so after I graduated from high school
            my father had already made it clear to me that he would not be able to pay my university fees for me, but it was not because he did not wants to pay, but all because of he did not have enough money to pay for all of us. This was the time i knew that i needed a sponsorship or then i will stop going to school. And I thank God that he blessed bless me with people who were 
            really willing to help me achieve my goal since they saw my reports from school.If it were not for my sponsor i really don't know how my life would have been because i would've stop studying. And a special thanks to them for helping me achieve my goals.
